## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#load data
d <- read.csv("all_data.csv")


#group data by question
#group participants by gender
names(d)[1] <- "Participant"
names(d)[2] <- "Consent"
names(d)[3] <- "Study"
names(d)[4] <- "Female1"
names(d)[5] <- "Female2"
names(d)[6] <- "Female3"
names(d)[7] <- "Female4"
names(d)[8] <- "Female5"
names(d)[9] <- "Female6"
names(d)[10] <- "Male1"
names(d)[11] <- "Male2"
names(d)[12] <- "Male3"
names(d)[13] <- "Male4"
names(d)[14] <- "Male5"
names(d)[15] <- "Male6"
names(d)[16] <- "StudyAbout"
names(d)[17] <- "dem_age"
names(d)[18] <- "dem_participant_gender"
names(d)[19] <- "dem_occupation"
names(d)[20] <- "dem_nationality"

#if female1 is NA, put in Male1 and if not NA put Female1: d$ means add this column into the dataframe
d$Q1_nurturing <- ifelse(is.na(d$Female1), d$Male1 , d$Female1  )
d$Q2_assertive <- ifelse(is.na(d$Female2), d$Male2 , d$Female2  )
d$Q3_aggressive <- ifelse(is.na(d$Female3), d$Male3 , d$Female3  )
d$Q4_emotion <- ifelse(is.na(d$Female4), d$Male4 , d$Female4  )
d$Q5_defensive <- ifelse(is.na(d$Female5), d$Male5 , d$Female5  )
d$Q6_etiquette <- ifelse(is.na(d$Female6), d$Male6 , d$Female6  )

#if female1 is NA, then this is the male character condition, else it is female character condition

d$condition <- ifelse (is.na(d$Female1), 'Male_character' , 'Female_character')

#subset, everything that goes before comma are the rows we want to keep and everything after is the columns we want to keep. Nothing before 1st comma means keep all the rows
#c() means make a list with all the column names we want to keep
#take d, save as d and take the following columns
d = d[, c( "Q1_nurturing" , "Q2_assertive", "Q3_aggressive", "Q4_emotion", "Q5_defensive", "Q6_etiquette", "Participant", "condition" , "dem_age", "dem_participant_gender" , "dem_occupation" , "dem_nationality" ) ] 


#male average across board, female average across board
#dont subset often because it isnt optimal - it basically reduces and splits the information
#demographic variables, subsetting only necessary columns


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#PLOT
#plot first because it gives us a sense of what we're looking at what to do an analysis on
#ggplot check long format when coding, what ggplot is designed for
#change wide to long format, common with plotting
d_long <- melt(d, id.vars = c("Participant","condition" , "dem_age", "dem_participant_gender" , "dem_occupation" , "dem_nationality"), measure.vars = c('Q1_nurturing' , 'Q2_assertive' , 'Q3_aggressive', 'Q4_emotion', 'Q5_defensive', 'Q6_etiquette'), variable.name = 'question' , value.name = 'acceptance' )
             

d_summary <- summarySE(d_long, measurevar = 'acceptance' , groupvars = c('question' , 'condition', 'dem_participant_gender'))

d_1 <- summarySE(d_long, measurevar = 'acceptance' , groupvars = c('question' , 'condition'))


#here is for plotting 
#aes for aesthetics and where variables go
#x var = question

plot1 <- ggplot (d_1, 
        aes(x = question, y = acceptance, fill = condition)) +
#now I add the bar plot and  
  geom_bar (position = 'dodge' , stat = 'identity') +
  #defines our margins
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=acceptance-se, ymax=acceptance+se),
                width = 0.2, position = position_dodge(0.9)) +
  #states the coordinates within the plot
  coord_cartesian (ylim= c(1,6))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(1,2,3,4,5,6))+
  #color scheme
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")

#same plot but split into men and women
plot2 <- ggplot (d_summary, 
        aes(x = question, y = acceptance, fill = condition)) +
#now I add the bar plot and  
  geom_bar (position = 'dodge' , stat = 'identity') +
  #defines our margins
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=acceptance-se, ymax=acceptance+se),
                width = 0.2, position = position_dodge(0.9)) +
  #states the coordinates within the plot
  coord_cartesian (ylim= c(1,6))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(1,2,3,4,5,6))+
  #color scheme
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")+
  facet_wrap(~dem_participant_gender)


#display.brewer.all()

plot1
plot2

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#multivariate binding, multiple variables. multiple output variables - multivariate model.
